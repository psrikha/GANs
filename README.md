Project Title: Comparative Analysis of GAN Networks

•	Description:
Implemented and compared three Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): ACGAN (Auxiliary Classifier GAN), DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN), and WGAN (Wasserstein GAN).
•	Key Points:
	•	Implemented ACGAN, DCGAN, and WGAN architectures.
	•	Compared performance metrics such as convergence speed, image quality, and stability.
	•	Evaluated each GAN’s suitability for different generative tasks.
